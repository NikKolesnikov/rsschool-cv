                <p>
                    I first became interested in the profession of a front-end developer a year ago.
                    At the moment, there is not much knowledge, tk. for some reason I couldn't do a lot, but now everything has changed. I believe that I will succeed.
                    I immersed myself in training. Sometimes it happens that nothing is clear, it is necessary
                    re-read the material that has not been studied in order to keep up with the guys who came to these courses
                    with the necessary knowledge. My goal is to become a front-end developer.

                    Honestly, knowledge began to take shape only now.
                    I work hard every minute of my free time.
                    I also hope that pretty soon I will be able to feel comfortable in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
