### Summary

I first became interested in the profession of a front-end developer a year ago.
At the moment, there is not much knowledge, tk. for some reason I couldn't do a lot, but now everything has changed. I believe that I will succeed.
I immersed myself in training. Sometimes it happens that nothing is clear, it is necessary
re-read the material that has not been studied in order to keep up with the guys who came to these courses
with the necessary knowledge. My goal is to become a front-end developer.

### Skills

`HTML5` `CSS3` `JavaScript` - baby basic lvl.

### Code examples

At the moment there is nothing, but I have everything ahead.

### Education and Experience

Honestly, knowledge began to take shape only now.
I work hard every minute of my free time.
I also hope that pretty soon I will be able to feel comfortable in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
