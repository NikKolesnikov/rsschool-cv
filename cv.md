### Summary

I first became interested in the profession of a front-end developer a year ago.
At the moment, there is not much knowledge, tk. for some reason I couldn't do a lot, but now everything has changed. I believe that I will succeed.
I immersed myself in training. Sometimes it happens that nothing is clear, it is necessary
re-read the material that has not been studied in order to keep up with the guys who came to these courses
with the necessary knowledge. My goal is to become a front-end developer.

### Skills

### Code examples

At the moment there is nothing, but I have everything ahead.
